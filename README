What? Library to collect network-based counters on BG/Q

How? Transparent interception of MPI_Init, MPI_Pcontrol, and MPI_Finalize.
Use MPI_Pcontrol around regions of interest. The argument passed to 
MPI_Pcontrol identifies the region. Multiple calls with same argument
leads to summation of counter values during such executions. Argument
value 0 is assumed at startup and is used by the library as a stopper.
Use positive values for specify start of your region of interest and
0 to mark the end. You can implicitly mark end of a region by starting
a new region. 

Limitation: Argument has to be <=9.

Output: Set environment variable BGQ_COUNTER_FILE to the output file
to which counters should be written. If the such a file can't be created,
the output is dumped to stdout.

Output format:
Each line of the output file contains data for a physical node. The meta 
data for a line is:

Pcontrol_region world_rank coords[0] coords[1] coords[2] coords[3] coords[4] coords[5] ** linkdata

link data = (d_A-) (d_A+) (d_B-) (d_B+) (d_C-) (d_C+) (d_D-) (d_D+) (d_E-) (d_E+)

d_* = sent_chunks (32 bytes)  dynamic_chunks deterministic_chunks col_packets (ignore) recv_packets (512 bytes) fifo_length

Hence, there are 60 entries that are part of linkdata.

Compilation:
1. In Makefile, point BGPM to installation location of bgpm.
2. make

Usage:
Link the profiler before your MPI library. Here is the link line that works
for me:

$(CC) -o mypgm mybin.o libprofiler.a -L $(BGPM)/lib -lbgpm -lrt -lstdc++

Test:
make test-all
Run the binary simple without any arguments on >= 2 processes.
