What? Library to collect network-based counters on BG/Q

How? Transparent interception of MPI_Init, MPI_Pcontrol, and MPI_Finalize.
Use MPI_Pcontrol around regions of interest. The argument passed to 
MPI_Pcontrol identifies the region. Multiple calls with same argument
leads to summation of counter values during such executions. Argument
value 0 is assumed at startup and is used by the library as a stopper.
Use positive values for specify start of your region of interest and
0 to mark the end. You can implicitly mark end of a region by starting
a new region. 

Limitation: Argument has to be <=9.

Compilation:
1. In Makefile, point BGPM to installation location of bgpm.
2. make

Usage:
Link the profiler before your MPI library. Here is the link line that works
for me:

$(CC) -o mypgm mybin.o libprofiler.a -L $(BGPM)/lib -lbgpm -lrt -lstdc++

Test:
make test-all
Run the binary simple without any arguments on >= 2 processes.
